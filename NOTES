Joining and creating lobbies:

    Blocking API:

        Bot.MakeLobby(title string) (Lobby, error)
        Bot.JoinLobby(channel string) (Lobby, error)

    Under the hood the Bot will:

        - run its single IRC message dispatcher
        - have pending MAKE requests array
        - have pending JOIN requests array
        - satisfy partially or fully or reject these requests as the messages get processed

    Each JOIN request will be the following:

        type joinRequest struct {
            Channel string
            Error chan error
        }

        Bot.JoinLobby() creates Error channel and waits on it. Recieved nil on this channel 
        indicates that the bot has successfully joined the channel and initialized the lobby struct
        which then can be queried using Bot's (lobbies map[string]*Lobby) field.

    Each MAKE request will be the following:

        type makeRequest struct {
            Title string
            Channel string
            Error chan error
        }

        Error is created and waited on by the caller, Title is set by the caller and Channel - by
        the dispatcher.

    When the dispatcher recieves 353 it searches through JOIN requests and satisfies the 
    one with the matching Channel. Otherwise it creates a new lobby struct in partially created
    lobby array and fills its player list and channel.

    When dispatcher recieves "Created the tournament" message it tries to match one lobby from MAKE
    list with partially created lobby by their title and satisfy the MAKE request.

    When dispatcher recieves 403 it searches through JOINs and rejects the one it finds.

    When dispatcher recieves "You cannot create any more tournament matches" message it rejects all
    pending MAKE requests.

    In summary, the bot will keep the following things:

        - lobbies map[string]*Lobby - for tracking all of the created lobbies
        - unIdentifiedLobbies map[string]*Lobby - for yet unidentified newly created lobbies
        - joinRequests []*joinRequest - list of pointers to requests shared between dispatcher and 
        - makeRequests []*makeRequest - and the caller

        Where

            type Lobby struct {
                Title string
                Channel string
                Players []string
            }

            type joinRequest struct {
                Channel string
                Error chan error
            }

            type makeRequest struct {
                Channel string
                Title string
                Error chan error
            }

    The dispatcher should join and close newly created lobbies that are not in the MAKE list because 
    their requests timed out and were removed from the list.
